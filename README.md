# Exoplanet Orbit Simulation

This project simulates the orbits of exoplanets around a star using gravitational physics. The animation models the positions and paths of each planet, providing a visual exploration of orbital mechanics and astrophysical concepts.

## Project Description

The simulation calculates gravitational forces acting on each planet due to the star and updates the planet positions accordingly. Using Python and Matplotlib, the project visually represents orbits and includes trails for each planet.

## Features

- Simulates multiple exoplanet orbits with unique masses, distances, and velocities.
- Displays real-time animations of planetary movements.
- Provides trails to track the paths of planets over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries by running:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python exoplanets.py
```
